### Phase 2.5: Multi-Service Infrastructure âœ…
- âœ… organization_services table created and deployed
- âœ… Surf Rehab configured with Cliniko service
- âœ… Service configuration includes AU4 region settings
- âœ… Sync scheduling and feature management in place
- âœ… API endpoints for organization service management

### Phase 3: Active Patient Definition âœ…
- âœ… **Active patients defined as: patients with appointments in last 45 days**

- âœ… Date range calculations updated (forty_five_days_ago)
- âœ… Complete sync_organization_active_patients method implemented
- âœ… Multi-step sync process with proper error handling

## ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

### Phase 3: Cliniko API Integration (Current)
**Status:** Implementation complete, ready for testing

**Key Components Implemented:**
- âœ… Complete sync workflow from Cliniko API to database

- âœ… Database storage with conflict resolution
- âœ… Organization service configuration checking
- âœ… Sync logging and error tracking

**Ready for Testing:**
- Surf Rehab active patient sync
- Production API integration
- End-to-end sync workflow

## ðŸ“‹ REMAINING PHASES

### Phase 4: API Endpoints âœ…

- âœ… Add filtering and pagination
- âœ… Implement organization-specific access control

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation 
- [ ] Test with Surf Rehab production data
- [ ] Validate patient matching logic
- [ ] Confirm appointment date filtering accuracy

### Phase 6: Sync Automation âœ…
- âœ… Implement scheduled sync jobs  
- âœ… Add sync monitoring and alerting
- âœ… Configure automatic retry logic

### Phase 7: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add caching for frequent API calls
- [ ] Implement incremental sync strategy
- [ ] Optimize database queries

### Phase 8: Error Handling & Monitoring
- [ ] Comprehensive error logging
- [ ] Sync status dashboard
- [ ] Alert notifications for failed syncs

### Phase 9: Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Deployment procedures
- [ ] Monitoring setup

### Phase 10: Multi-Organization Scaling
- [ ] Bulk sync operations
- [ ] Rate limiting per organization
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT STATUS

**âœ… Infrastructure Complete:**
- Database schema and relationships
- Credential management and encryption
- Organization services architecture
- Complete sync service implementation

**ðŸ”„ Ready for Testing:**
- Active patient sync for Surf Rehab
- 45-day appointment filtering
- Contact matching and data storage

**ðŸ“Š Key Metrics:**
- Surf Rehab: 631 patients accessible via Cliniko API
- Active patient definition: appointments in last 45 days
- Multi-tenant support: organization_services table
- Sync frequency: configurable (default: every 30 minutes)

**ðŸŽ¯ Next Action:** Test the complete sync workflow with Surf Rehab

## Key Requirements

### Data Mapping
```sql
-- Target table structure
create table public.active_patients (
  id bigserial not null,
  contact_id uuid not null,                    -- Links to contacts table
  recent_appointment_count integer not null,   -- Appointments in last 60 days
  upcoming_appointment_count integer not null, -- Future appointments
  total_appointment_count integer not null,    -- All appointments for patient
  last_appointment_date timestamp,             -- Most recent appointment
  recent_appointments jsonb,                   -- Recent appointment details
  upcoming_appointments jsonb,                 -- Upcoming appointment details
  search_date_from timestamp,                  -- Search range start (60 days ago)
  search_date_to timestamp,                    -- Search range end (today)
  organization_id text,                        -- Organization isolation
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
);
```

### API Credentials Required
- `api_key`: Cliniko API key
- `region`: Cliniko region (e.g., "au4") 
- `api_url`: Full API URL (e.g., "https://api.au4.cliniko.com/v1")

### Success Criteria
- [x] Credentials stored securely for Surf Rehab
- [x] Can retrieve and decrypt credentials
- [x] Can authenticate with Cliniko API
- [ ] Can fetch patients and appointments
- [ ] Can identify active patients (1+ appointments in 60 days)
- [ ] Can map Cliniko patients to contacts table
- [ ] Can store results in active_patients table
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation working correctly
- [ ] Proper error handling and logging

## Notes
- Using existing credential storage system in `api_credentials` table
- Leveraging Fernet encryption with `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- Building on patterns from `cliniko_backup/` folder
- Need to handle Cliniko API rate limits
- Active patient definition: 1+ appointments in last 60 days
