# Step-by-Step Patient Analytics Sequence for Cliniko Integration

## Phase 1: Data Discovery & Organization Setup

### Step 1: Identify Active Organizations
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/cliniko/debug/contacts/{organization_id}` 
- **Purpose**: Test which organization IDs have active data
- **Action**: Loop through known organization IDs to find which ones return data
- **Output**: List of active organizations to analyze

### Step 2: Check Sync Status
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/cliniko/status/{organization_id}`
- **Purpose**: Verify data freshness and sync health
- **Action**: For each active organization, check when data was last synced
- **Output**: Sync status report per organization

## Phase 2: Patient Data Collection

### Step 3: Extract Active Patients
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/cliniko/active-patients/{organization_id}`
- **Purpose**: Get comprehensive list of active patients
- **Key Data Points**:
  - Patient ID and contact information
  - Total appointment counts
  - Recent activity indicators
  - Contact details (name, phone, email)

### Step 4: Get Patient Summaries
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/cliniko/active-patients/{organization_id}/summary`
- **Purpose**: Get aggregated statistics per organization
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Total active patient count
  - Activity distribution
  - High-level engagement metrics

## Phase 3: Appointment Analysis

### Step 5: Extract Contacts With Appointments
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/cliniko/contacts/{organization_id}/with-appointments`
- **Purpose**: Get detailed appointment information for each patient
- **Key Data Points**:
  - Upcoming appointment dates and times
  - Appointment types (Initial, Follow-up, Treatment, etc.)
  - Appointment frequency patterns
  - Provider/practitioner assignments

### Step 6: Analyze Appointment Patterns
- **Data Processing**:
  - Group appointments by type
  - Calculate time until next appointment
  - Identify patients overdue for follow-ups
  - Categorize appointment urgency

## Phase 4: Advanced Analytics

### Step 7: Patient Prioritization
- **Metrics to Calculate**:
  - Days since last appointment
  - Frequency of appointments
  - Upcoming appointment urgency
  - Treatment completion status
  - No-show patterns

### Step 8: Appointment Type Distribution
- **Analysis Points**:
  - Most common appointment types per organization
  - Seasonal patterns in appointment scheduling
  - Provider workload distribution
  - Patient journey progression (Initial → Follow-up → Treatment)

## Phase 5: Reporting & Insights

### Step 9: Generate Organization Reports
- **Per Organization Metrics**:
  - Total active patients
  - Patients with upcoming appointments
  - Patients overdue for follow-ups
  - Appointment type breakdown
  - Average days between appointments

### Step 10: Cross-Organization Analysis
- **Comparative Metrics**:
  - Patient engagement rates by organization
  - Appointment type preferences
  - Scheduling efficiency
  - Patient retention indicators

## Key Analytics Outputs

### Patient-Level Insights
- **Patient Priority Score**: Based on appointment urgency, treatment history, and engagement
- **Next Appointment Details**: Type, date, and provider
- **Treatment Journey Stage**: Where patient is in their care pathway
- **Engagement Level**: Active, at-risk, or dormant

### Organization-Level Insights
- **Capacity Utilization**: How well appointment slots are being used
- **Patient Flow**: Movement through different appointment types
- **Scheduling Efficiency**: Optimal appointment spacing patterns
- **Revenue Opportunity**: Patients ready for upselling or additional services

### Actionable Recommendations
- **Follow-up Reminders**: Patients overdue for appointments
- **Capacity Optimization**: Best times to schedule different appointment types
- **Patient Retention**: At-risk patients needing proactive outreach
- **Resource Planning**: Provider scheduling based on appointment type demand

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Quality Checks
- Validate appointment dates are in correct format
- Check for missing or inconsistent patient information
- Verify appointment types are standardized across organizations

### Error Handling
- Handle organizations with no data gracefully
- Manage API timeouts and connection issues
- Provide fallback data when specific endpoints fail

### Output Formats
- CSV files for detailed patient records
- Summary reports for management dashboards
- JSON exports for integration with other systems
- Visual charts showing trends and patterns

This systematic approach will give you comprehensive insights into patient engagement, appointment scheduling patterns, and organizational performance across your Cliniko integration.
