/*
===========================================
PATIENT REENGAGEMENT MASTER VIEW - v1.2 APPOINTMENT-ONLY
===========================================
Replaces 4 Python services with optimized PostgreSQL:
- reengagement_risk_service.py
- communication_tracking_service.py  
- benchmark_service.py
- predictive_risk_service.py

FIXES IN v1.2 (Appointment-Only):
✅ Fixed "999 days_to_next_appointment" - now shows NULL properly
✅ Appointment-based risk scoring (conversation data not available yet)
✅ Contact success prediction based on attendance rates
✅ Lower risk scores for new patients (0 appointments = low risk)
✅ Realistic risk distribution across patient base
✅ Graceful handling of missing conversation data

This view calculates:
✅ Risk scores (0-100) based purely on appointment patterns
✅ Risk levels (critical/high/medium/low/engaged)
✅ Days since last contact (from appointments)
✅ Missed appointments analysis
✅ Appointment attendance patterns
✅ Action priorities & recommendations
✅ Industry benchmarks comparison (appointment-based)

/*
Performance Notes:
- This view replaces ~200 lines of Python risk calculation code
- Leverages PostgreSQL's optimization for complex aggregations
- Uses CTEs for readable, maintainable logic
- Calculated columns can be indexed for sub-100ms queries
- JSON aggregation handles complex appointment history efficiently
